This lens technology evolves the traditional corrective lenses into a true medical treatment, and it marks the beginning of a new era for eyecare professionals in addressing myopia. We are thrilled to have been granted FDA’s market authorization for Essilor Stellest in the U.S., bringing it to young patients in need.
